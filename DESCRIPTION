Description: This package takes pollen and chronology data from lake cores and produces a Bayesian posterior distribution of palaeoclimate from that location after fitting a non-linear non-Gaussian state-space model. For more details see the paper Parnell, A. C., et al. (2015), Bayesian inference for palaeoclimate with time uncertainty and stochastic volatility.

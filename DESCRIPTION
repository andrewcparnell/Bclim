Description: Takes pollen and chronology data from lake cores and produces
    a Bayesian posterior distribution of palaeoclimate from that location after
    fitting a non-linear non-Gaussian state-space model. For more details see the
    paper Parnell, A. C., et al. (2015), Bayesian inference for palaeoclimate with
    time uncertainty and stochastic volatility. Journal of the Royal Statistical
    Society: Series C (Applied Statistics), 64: 115â€“138.

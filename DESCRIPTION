Title: Bayesian Palaeoclimate Reconstruction from Pollen Data
Version: 3.1.0

Author: Andrew Parnell
Maintainer: Andrew Parnell <Andrew.Parnell@ucd.ie>
Description: Takes pollen and chronology data from lake cores and produces a Bayesian posterior distribution of palaeoclimate from that location after fitting a non-linear non-Gaussian state-space model. For more details see the paper Parnell, A. C., et al. (2015), Bayesian inference for palaeoclimate with time uncertainty and stochastic volatility. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C (Applied Statistics), 64: 115â€“138.
